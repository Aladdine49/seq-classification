RNA Type Classification with CNN
About the Project

This project focuses on classifying different types of RNA, specifically messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and repeated regions. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can distinguish between these RNA types using advanced machine learning techniques.
Context

RNA plays a crucial role in genetic regulation and expression. Differentiating between mRNA, lncRNA, and repeated regions is essential for understanding their distinct biological functions and implications in various diseases. Traditional methods of RNA classification can be time-consuming and may not always capture the subtle differences between these types.
Solution

To address this challenge, we have implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. CNNs are particularly effective for pattern recognition in sequential data, making them well-suited for genomic sequences analysis. Our model processes RNA sequences as inputs and classifies them into mRNA, lncRNA, or repeated regions.
